1. Hours to complete the project: 8 hours

2. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Model a Percolation System): First of all, the project was
     challenging to understand. I didn't know I will have to use variables for
     sink and source, as it wasn't directly in the checklist. When I understood
     that it was relatively easy.

     I also struggled a bit with the coding part in the isFull method. I knew
     what I need to do, but I just didn't know how to code it, then my friend
     Herbert helped me to figure that out.

   Problem 2 (Estimate Percolation Threshold): I didn't really face any
     problem in this part.

3. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS210 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.
