1. Hours to complete the project: 8 hours

2. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Deque): I needed some time to figure out this problem, but I
					looked at the class slides, which helped me to 
					understand the content of the project.

   Problem 2 (Random Queue): After doing the first one, I became more 
					comfortable with coding for this problem, but I faced an 
					error after doing this just because of initializing
					the array twice.

   Problem 3 (Subset): This was pretty easy.
   
3. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS210 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.
