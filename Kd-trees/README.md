The purpose of this assignment is to create a symbol table data type whose keys are two-dimensional points. The program uses a
2d-tree to support efficient range search and k-nearest neighbor search. 2d-trees have numerous applications, ranging from classifying astronomical
objects to computer animation to speeding up neural networks to mining data to image retrieval.
