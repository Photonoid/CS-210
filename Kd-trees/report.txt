1. Hours to complete the project: 8 hours

2. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Brute-force Implementation): I faced a lot of problems while doing this problem, most of the
		problems were trying to put the checklist in codes. One of the bigger problems I faced was the
		numbers were not similar to the results while calculating the nearest points. The second rows of
		my numbers used to match with the first rows from the actual pdf. Later what I figured out was the
		point was also calculating the point from itself in the nearest method. I also faced errors as I 
		missed the corner cases.

   Problem 2 (2d-tree Implementation): This program was really hard. I had a hard time to do it most 
		of the methods. So, I took help from sample problems online to understand the concepts and follow 
		checklist.

3. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS210 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.
