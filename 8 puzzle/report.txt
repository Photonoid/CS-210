1. Hours to complete the project: 10-12 hours

2. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Board Data Type): I have faced a lot of errors. I faced a few errors 
		just because of missing paranthesis. Another problem I faced was the wrong the
		puzzle showed different numbers than expected output. The tutor helped me to fix
		those.
   Problem 2 (Solver Data Type): Problem 2 was a bit easier than the first one
		to me, but I was couldn't finish the solver method, using the checklist I could finish
		some of it. I took help from the tutor

3. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS210 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

Alex				Tutor			Helped me with most of the methods from Problem 1
									like hamming, manhattan, blankPos, inversion, isSolvable,
									neighbors and better understand the concepts. Also, helped
									me to solve several errors from Problem 1.
									
									I also took help to do the solver method, implementing hamming and 
									manhattan helper methods.

I also took help from internet to do problem 2. https://github.com/Toddses/CourseraGit/blob/master/Algorithms%20Part%201/8puzzle/Solver.java
